This is small collection of useful scripts and configuration
to get you started.

Premise is simple: you have several modems connected to eth0
and you are using some other device (e.g. wifi, other network card) to
connect to internet.

We will configure two networks:

192.168.1.240/28
10.0.0.0/8

First one is to accomodate Thompson's default setting of 192.168.1.254.

Even if your internet connection uses gateway on 192.168.1.1 it will still
work unless you are using IP addresses over 192.168.1.240.

Then execute:

./net.sh

or with some other network device:

./net.sh eth1
